 The __&lt;a&gt;__ element defines a hyperlink to a location on the same page or 
 any other page on the Web. It can also be used (in an obsolete way) to create an 
 anchor pointâ€”a destination for hyperlinks within the content of a page, so that links 
 aren't limited to connecting simply to the top of a page.
 
 Example:
 
 <table style='width:100%; border-style:none'>
     <tr style='vertical-align: top'>
         <td style='border-style:none'>
         
 <pre data-language='ceylon'>
 A { href=\"http://ceylon-lang.org\"; \"Ceylon\" }
 </pre>
 
         </td>
         <td style='border-style:none'>
         
 <pre data-language='html'>
 &lt;a href=\"http://ceylon-lang.org\"&gt;Ceylon&lt;/a&gt;
 </pre>
 
         </td>         
     </tr>
 </table>
