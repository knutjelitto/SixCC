 The __&lt;script&gt;__ element is used to embed or reference an executable script 
 within an HTML or XHTML document. Scripts without async or defer attributes, as well as 
 inline scripts, are fetched and executed immediately, before the browser continues to parse the page.
 
 Example:
 
 <table style='width:100%'>
     <tr style='vertical-align: top'>
         <td style='border-style:none'>
         
 <pre data-language='ceylon'>
 Head {
     Script { src=\"js/bootstrap.min.js\"; }
 };
 </pre>
 
         </td>
         <td style='border-style:none'>
         
 <pre data-language='html'>
 &lt;head&gt;
     &lt;script src=\"js/bootstrap.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
 </pre>
         </td>         
     </tr>
 </table>
