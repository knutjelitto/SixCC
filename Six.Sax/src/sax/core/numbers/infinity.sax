"""
An instance of [[Float]] representing positive infinity, \{#221E}, the result of dividing a positive number by zero.
Negative infinity, -\{#221E}, the result of dividing a negative number by zero, is the additive inverse `-infinity`.

Note that any floating-point computation that results in a positive value too large to be represented as a `Float` is
"rounded up" to `infinity`. Likewise, any floating-point computation that yields a negative value whose magnitude is
too large to be represented as a `Float` is "rounded down" to `-infinity`.
